# AI Development Assistance

This project has been developed with assistance from artificial intelligence tools, specifically:

- **GitHub Copilot** - AI pair programmer for code completion and suggestions
- **Claude (Anthropic)** - AI assistant for architecture design, code review, documentation, and problem-solving

## Scope of AI Usage

AI tools have been used throughout the development process for:

- **Code Generation**: Implementing features, handlers, database queries, and frontend components
- **Documentation**: Writing and maintaining technical documentation, API references, and user guides
- **Architecture Design**: Designing system components, database schemas, and API structures
- **Code Review**: Identifying potential issues, suggesting improvements, and ensuring best practices
- **Debugging**: Troubleshooting issues and proposing solutions
- **Refactoring**: Improving code quality, structure, and maintainability

## Human Oversight

All AI-generated code and documentation has been:

- Reviewed and validated by human developers
- Tested for functionality and security
- Modified as needed to meet project requirements
- Integrated thoughtfully into the overall architecture

## Responsibility

The project maintainers take full responsibility for all code, documentation, and decisions made in this project, whether AI-assisted or not. AI tools have been used as productivity aids, not as a replacement for human judgment and expertise.
