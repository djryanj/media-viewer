# User Guide Overview

This guide provides comprehensive documentation for all Media Viewer features. Whether you're browsing your collection, organizing with tags, or managing playlists, you'll find detailed instructions here.

## Core Concepts

### Gallery

The gallery is the main interface for browsing your media library. It displays items in a responsive grid that adapts to your screen size. Items can be folders, images, videos, or playlists.

### Lightbox

The lightbox is a full-screen viewer for images and videos. It provides navigation controls, media information, and quick access to tagging and favorites.

### Tags

Tags are labels you assign to media items for organization. An item can have multiple tags, and tags can be searched, filtered, and managed in bulk.

### Favorites

Favorites are bookmarked items that appear in a quick-access strip at the top of the gallery. Use favorites for items you access frequently.

### Playlists

Playlists are collections of videos that play in sequence. They are defined as text files in your media library.

## Interface Elements

### Header

The header contains:

- **Application title**: Click to return to the root directory
- **Search box**: Find media by name or tag
- **Sort controls**: Change sort field and order
- **Filter dropdown**: Show specific media types
- **User controls**: Change password, clear cache, logout

### Breadcrumb

The breadcrumb shows your current location in the folder hierarchy. Click any segment to navigate to that folder.

### Gallery Grid

The main content area displays media items in a grid. On desktop, items show additional metadata including type, size, and tags.

### Favorites Strip

When you have favorites, they appear in a horizontal scrollable strip below the breadcrumb.
